[WIP]
[InitialVersion]This will be a Discord bot for checking the attendance of certain events.
The user will be able to specify either a timeframe (FromTime,ToTime) or a duration
(FromTime = NOW,EndTime = NOW + duration)

The duration shall be appended with a letter to indicate the time units
	s - seconds; m - minutes (default); h - hours

[later]It shall also be possible to automate such processes.

[output]
[initialVersion]	The names of attendees shall be send via PM to the issuer of command.
			An alternative would be to post it in a fixed channel.
[later]		Output shall be directly pushed to an online form (or something similar)
		Also there may be a possibility implemented to issue warnings to the Server admins if 
		an individual's attendence is below a given threshold.
